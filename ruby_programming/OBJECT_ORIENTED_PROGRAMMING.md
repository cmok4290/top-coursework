OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING
## Learning Outcomes

### Classes and Methods:
- What is an implicit return?
-- The return value of the last evaluated expression

- What is a class?
-- A class is just a way of organizing and producing objects with similar attributes and methods.
-- Basic outlines of what an object should be makde of and what it should be able to do.
-- A class can be thought of as a factory that makes objects.

- When should you use a class?
-- When you want to manipulate data of objects with similar and complex structure

- How do you create a class in your script file?
-- ``` class NewClass
        # Class magic here
       end
   ```
- What is an instance of a class?
-- An object is an instance of a class.

- What is the difference between Pascal Case and snake_case styles of naming?
-- Pascal case formatting is created using no spaces and capitalizes every word
-- snake_case formatting is created using all lowercase letters and separating words with the underscore character

- How do you instantiate a class?
-- You instantiate a class by using the `class` keyword

- How do you set the state of your new instance?
-- You can set up your object's state in the `#initialize` method

- What should be done in the #initialize method?
-- You should designate instance variables e.g. `@variable_name`

- What is a class method?
-- A class method is a method called on the class

- How is a class method different from an instance method?
-- A class method isn't called on the specific instance of that class

- How are methods you already know like #count or #sort, etc. instance methods?
-- These methods are called on an individual instance of that class

- What's the difference between how you declare a class method vs an instance method?
-- You declare a class method preceding its name with `self`, name of the class, or `class << self` 

- What's the difference between how you call a class method vs an instance method?

- What is an instance variable?
-- Instance variable store the object's state or data

- What's the difference between an `instance` variable and a `regular` variable?

- What are `getter` and `setter` methods used for?

- How do you make instance variables readable outside your class? Writeable? Both at the same time?

- Can a class call its own class methods?

- What's the difference between when you would use a class variable and when you would use a constant?

- What's the difference between a class and a module?

- When would you use a class but not a module?

- How does inheritance work?

- Why is inheritance really useful?

- How do you extend a class? What does that mean?

- What does `#super` do? Why use it?

## Scope:
- What is scope?

- When can you start using a variable?

- When is a new scope defined?

- When are methods in scope?

- What is a private method?

- What is a protected method?

- How are private and protected methods different?

- What does `encapsulation` mean?
